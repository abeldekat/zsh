# 1 autoload compinit
# 2 Add all defined plugins to fpath. This must be done before running compinit.
# 3 Delete the zcompdump file if OMZ zcompdump metadata changed
# 4 Compfix and compinit
# 5 Source /lib/*.zsh. Directories.zsh and cli.zsh do contain compdef invocations
# 6 Source plugins. Not the _(name) plugins. Load theme
# My approach: Run compinit as if it where inside the framework. So, before sourcing plugins.
# Thus, any compdef invocation will work. If the plugin has a _(name) completion file this needs to be 
# added to the fpath manually before compinit. Ripgrep on compinit and compdef
